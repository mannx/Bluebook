- frontend2b is being used to trim down the frontend and rewriting some sections

- once main features complete, backend and frontend2 can be removed and remainging directories renamed

Known TODO List
  * Frontend error reporting worked on
  
  * When importing daily sheets, a new row is created and an Update flag set
    on the pre-existing row if we are updating data.
    This only happens on the daily, the control sheet doesn't need to do this.
    Can use this flag to revert data in case a wrong date was used in the daily sheet
    This does break tags, and those needed to be reworked anyway
  
  * Tags been reworked
    Tags are now stored as a space seperated list of id's from the tag_list table
     in day_data.Tags
    If no tags are found for the day, this field is null
  
  * Error parsing control and/or wisr simply returns an Error and panics
     should return something more user friendly to the user to indicate an
     error occurred



Migration Steps
---------------

To Migrate to the backend-rust version follow
  1) Shutdown previous container
  2) Backup database
  3) Rename database to db.mig
  4) Set BLUEBOOK_MIG_TAG environment variable to anything to migrate tags
  4) Run new container
  5) Make sure migration worked
  6) Clear BLUEBOOK_MIG_TAG from compose, as only need to migrate tags once
